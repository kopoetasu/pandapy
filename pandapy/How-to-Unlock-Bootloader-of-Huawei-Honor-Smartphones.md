Unlocking the bootloader allows you to modify the software on your device and customize it to your liking. However, Huawei has stopped providing official bootloader unlock codes for its devices since 2018, making it harder for users to unlock their devices.

## Method 1: Using a third-party service
 
One way to unlock the bootloader of your Huawei Honor device is to use a third-party service that can generate the bootloader unlock code for you. There are several websites that offer this service, such as [DC Unlocker](https://www.dc-unlocker.com/), [Ministry of Solutions](https://ministryofsolutions.com/), or [FunkyHuawei](https://www.funkyhuawei.club/). However, these services are not free and may charge you a fee ranging from $4 to $55 depending on your device model and region. Also, these services are not officially endorsed by Huawei or Honor, so use them at your own risk.
 
Here are the steps to unlock the bootloader of your Huawei Honor device using the DC Unlocker service:
 
1. Download and extract the zip file for the [DC Unlocker tool](https://www.dc-unlocker.com/downloads/get/6QZ0Yxq1).
2. Launch the dc-unlocker2client.exe file and log in to the server. You need to create an account and buy some credits to use this service.
3. Enable Manufacturer Mode on your phone by typing `*#*#2846579#*#*` into the dial pad. Then go to Project Menu > Background Settings > USB Port Settings > Manufacturer Mode.
4. Connect your phone to your PC using a USB cable and make sure you have installed the proper drivers. You can download the drivers from [here](https://www.dc-unlocker.com/downloads/get/6QZ0Yxq1).
5. Select your device model from the drop-down menu in the DC Unlocker tool and click on the magnifying glass icon to detect your device.
6. Click on the Server tab and then click on Read Bootloader Code. Wait for a few seconds until you get the bootloader unlock code.
7. Copy the bootloader unlock code and save it somewhere safe.
8. Reboot your phone into fastboot mode by holding down the Volume Down and Power buttons together.
9. Open a command prompt window on your PC and navigate to the folder where you extracted the DC Unlocker tool.
10. Type `fastboot devices` and press Enter to make sure your device is detected.
11. Type `fastboot oem unlock [your bootloader unlock code]` and press Enter. Replace [your bootloader unlock code] with the code you got from step 6.
12. Your device will display a warning message and ask you to confirm the bootloader unlocking process. Press Volume Up to confirm and wait for the process to finish.
13. Your device will reboot automatically and wipe all your data. Congratulations, you have successfully unlocked the bootloader of your Huawei Honor device!

## Method 2: Using an open-source tool
 
Another way to unlock the bootloader of your Huawei Honor device is to use an open-source tool called [PotatoNV](https://github.com/mashed-potatoes/PotatoNV). This tool can generate the bootloader unlock code for devices that are based on HiSilicon Kirin 960/659/655 chipsets. However, this method requires you to open up your device and access some test points on the motherboard, which can be risky and void your warranty. Also, this method
